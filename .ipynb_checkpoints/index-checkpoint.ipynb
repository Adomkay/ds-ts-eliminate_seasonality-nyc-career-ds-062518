    "\n",
    "One of the most common methods of dealing with both trend and seasonality is differencing. In this technique, we take the difference of the observation at a particular instant with that at the previous instant (i.e. Lag).  This mostly works well in improving stationarity. First order differencing can be done in Pandas using the `shift()` function to shift the values in the index by a specified number of units of the index's period. Details of `.shift()` can be viewed [HERE](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.shift.html).\n",

    "Time series decomposition is a mathematical procedure which transforms a time series into multiple different time series. The original time series is often split into 3 component series:\n",

    ">Seasonal: Patterns that repeat with a fixed period of time. For example, a website might receive more visits during weekends; this would produce data with a seasonality of 7 days.\n",
